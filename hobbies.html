        <h2>Interview with Bill Collier</h2>

        <div class="interview-item">
          <h3>What inspired you to begin wrestling at 25?</h3>
          <p>“I was 25 and saw my size as a real advantage. I was working construction and one day thought, ‘Why not try wrestling?’ Six weeks into training, I got thrown into a ring, and I never looked back.”</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-item">
          <h3>How did training with Ken “Kato” Downs shape your style?</h3>
          <p>“Ken showed me the difference between having potential and being a professional. He drilled consistency into me. Wrestling isn’t something you master—it's something you keep learning.”</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-item">
          <h3>Which win, ESW, IWC, or Greektown, felt most significant?</h3>
          <p>“Winning the IWC Heavyweight Championship was big. It was the main event, packed crowd, years of grind paying off. That night validated 15 years of work.”</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-item">
          <h3>Describe your AEW Dark Elevation matches vs. Jon Moxley and Adam Page.</h3>
          <p>“Three nights in a row, tag match, then Mox choked me out, then Hangman caught me with the Lariat. But they both respected me: Mox gave a nod, Page shared a beer. That meant a lot.”</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-item">
          <h3>What adjustments did you make to overcome injuries in 2017?</h3>
          <p>“Wrist and knee issues forced me to smarten up. Less impact, more rehab, more mobility work. I had to evolve my in-ring pacing.”</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-item">
          <h3>How do you balance wrestling with family and work?</h3>
          <p>“I operate heavy machinery full-time, I’m a husband, and I’m a dad. My weekends are packed. I’ve driven to Toronto and back in a day for a match.”</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-item">
          <h3>What’s behind your nickname “Big Time”?</h3>
          <p>“I’m 6'5", 255. I bring a presence, and I show up for big moments. ‘Big Time’ isn’t just the nickname; it’s the standard I set.”</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-item">
          <h3>Who in AEW would you most like to face next?</h3>
          <p>“Wardlow. Or The Butcher & The Blade. I’ve worked with all of them on the indies, they’re tough, and I respect them.”</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-item">
          <h3>What’s your training and diet routine like now?</h3>
          <p>“Core, cardio, ring drills, plus rehab and stretching. Diet is clean, lean meats, veggies. I stay sharp year-round.”</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-item">
          <h3>What are your long-term goals in wrestling?</h3>
          <p>“A contract with AEW is the dream. But more than that? To prove that it’s never too late. That’s what I stand for.”</p>
